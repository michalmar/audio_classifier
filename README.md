## Installation

install ffmpeg: https://pythonbasics.org/convert-mp3-to-wav/
install requirements

### RUN
1. convert MP3 to WAV `python convert_mp3_to_wav.py "../COVID-19-train-audio/not-covid19-coughs/PMID-16436200" cough`

1. [OPTIONAL] prepare sample data (other class) 

`wget https://mmadlbs.blob.core.windows.net/share/ambient.mp3`
`python convert_wav_to_slices_by_time.py ./tmp 2`

1. extract features `python feature_extract.py "./data" "./features/out.csv"` 


1. run classification ... so far manually
